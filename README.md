The availability of geo-referenced coupled data of different platforms is essential to train remote sensing (RS) multi-modal classification and bio-phyiscal parameter estimation learning methods. To properly develop a generalizing model different scenes and topographies are required. For this purpose, different multi-modal datasets have been published for the last years. Nevertheless, to our knowledge there is not any dataset composed of Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-3 (S3) geo-referenced images. In this paper we present SEN23, a dataset composed of 100 complete multi-spectral S2 and S3 paired images of different locations along Europe from the 2021 summer. The coupled images were obtained with a time difference of three or less days, containing less than a 1\% of cloud coverage and have a resolution difference of $\times15$. SEN23E is expected to help with the development of new multi-spectral, multi-resolution and multi-modal models for complex tasks which need context and complete images.
